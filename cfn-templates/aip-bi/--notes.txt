Notes and To-Do list:

NAT instance type Allowed values - needs to be updated

Mappings AWSNATAMI - requires updates for non-us-east-1 regions

Polices - definition needs to be provided. May need seperate CF template for this or depend on manual creation in each region/account. Case - ETL-Role is defined in aip-bi-aws-resources.cfn.json, but does not create the role under IAM. Unless the role already exists, the CF launch fails.

remove ApplicatoinSourceBundle - from all beanstalk related templates.

Admin VPC template - set DHCP option to true in support of R53.

To-Dos:
	- Review Platform Services docs on Confluence
	- Jenkins: Port 9418 open Privage SG Outbound & Inbound thru Nat instance. Update Admin VPC template. User Date Git command need. Verify with Andreas again.
	- DNS - make a Public file. Also, automate privte VPC Id finding and template constructiion
	- Admin VPC: Setup VPN stack or make seperate stack. Must add Route VPG to Private subnets (not Public however).
	- IAM roles: defined in CF for Admin and All Beanstalk needs, Lambda
	- Lockdown Public visibility of BI apps via SG or other
	- Add to vpc private database SG - PostgreSQL inbound from 10.85.0.0/16 (for Workstation PGadmin from Admin VPC use)

Issues - CNAME - each app delete stack operation requies MANUAL removal of CNAME value - not so great!

Note: Jenkins database connection must be URI encoded as part of connection string. 
We have to remember to URI encode the credentials as well for Jenkins:
	postgres://api_user:SomePassword%24%25%233@bi-dev-rds-dw-us-east-1d.c1lwzjddrfro.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/postgres

Need to ensure left over apps are not still in Beanstalk.

Fix ETL App Subnets:
Web tier subnets: subnet-c2b583e9,subnet-8f29f3b2
ETL tier subnets: subnet-c1b583ea,subnet-8e29f3b3

VPC deployments: - R53 manual associate aip.local and aliniqbis.local for each vpc after create event.

Region porting notes eu-central-1:
Create keys - aip-adm-keys
Pick an Amazone Linux NAT (HVM) AMI in each region. Same to --NAT notes file.

	I have updated the sa password for the aws-informatics (Public Dev) and bi-dev-rds-dw-us-east-1 (CI/CD Dev) to Pr0jectOnT!me so as to match the standard password in use by the other instances. We will now have the same sa password across all instances.
