Notes and To-Do list:

NAT instance type Allowed values - needs to be updated

Mappings AWSNATAMI - requires updates for non-us-east-1 regions

Polices - definition needs to be provided. May need seperate CF template for this or depend on manual creation in each region/account. Case - ETL-Role is defined in aip-bi-aws-resources.cfn.json, but does not create the role under IAM. Unless the role already exists, the CF launch fails.

remove ApplicatoinSourceBundle - from all beanstalk related templates.

Admin VPC template - set DHCP option to true in support of R53.

To-Dos:
	- Review Platform Services docs on Confluence
	- Jenkins: Port 9418 open Privage SG Outbound & Inbound thru Nat instance. Update Admin VPC template. User Date Git command need. Verify with Andreas again.
	- DNS - make a Public file. Also, automate privte VPC Id finding and template constructiion
	- Admin VPC: Setup VPN stack or make seperate stack. Must add Route VPG to Private subnets (not Public however).
	- IAM roles: defined in CF for Admin and All Beanstalk needs, Lambda
	- Lockdown Public visibility of BI apps via SG or other

Issues - CNAME - each app delete stack operation requies MANUAL removal of CNAME value - not so great!

Need to ensure left over apps are not still in Beanstalk.
