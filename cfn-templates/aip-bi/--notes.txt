Notes and To-Do list:

NAT instance type Allowed values - needs to be updated

Mappings AWSNATAMI - requires updates for non-us-east-1 regions

Polices - definition needs to be provided. May need seperate CF template for this or depend on manual creation in each region/account. Case - ETL-Role is defined in aip-bi-aws-resources.cfn.json, but does not create the role under IAM. Unless the role already exists, the CF launch fails.

remove ApplicatoinSourceBundle - from all beanstalk related templates.

Admin VPC template - set DHCP option to true in support of R53.
